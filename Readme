A. This company is mainly into infrastructure based development  , My work here for the past years has been on Automation's for handling incident, service now , different technologies like linux 
and windows where automations where deveopled to check services , disk usage and many such stuffs, Also had worked on network based automaion's in accessing the end points (API)
of the clients where details where provided and workflows where designed accordingly to monitor the entire ITIL standard's and update the ticktes based on the request. 
ALL the service requests and change requests tickets where processed and hanldled with multiple automations. 
Had Handled ansible tower's response to check job and status of any ansible tower where the main automationFrame work is to handle the complete ansible process.
Had prepared multiple such automations for incident, NDM, change request and changetask.
